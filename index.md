## Starting point
----

First of all I want to introduce myself as the author of this "blog".
My name is Oscar, I'm an argentinian guy living in Australia, trying to build a community with my new startup Perffy, a social network for performers.

At the time of speaking I've just released the app for iPhone and Android for a group of 100 beta testers willing to have all of them aboard as soon as possible.

I'm working at Canvas, a coworking space thanks to Toowoomba Startup Group who have trusted in the idea since the begining and are mentoring me to be able to reach the sky!

Also, as you may notice my English is not the best, so this is a space I will use to improve it writing about my experience in Australia and with the startup ecosystem with Perffy

Hope this can be useful, not just for me as I want to share my thoughs about the technology that I'm working on too.

Well, let's do it!
